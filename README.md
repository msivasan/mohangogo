What this Project does:

Consider the below feature we are looking for development and release in 3 weeks. We are developing a search tool for amazon.com. for our consideration.

●        Go to amazon.com

●        In the search dropdown list, choose ‘Books’ option.

●        Enter search text ‘data’. A bunch of test results will be displayed. Choose the first test result (first product listed on the search result page) and read/record as many details related to that particular test result as possible. For example, title of the book, price of the book for different editions, be it paperback/hardcopy or kindle edition, etc. Make the above functionality as generic as possible and componentize this functionality.
